<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am a third-year Software Engineering student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, expected to earn my B.S. in Engineering in 2027. My research interests primarily focus on Efficient Large Language Models (LLMs), with additional interests in Reinforcement Learning (RL), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), and Embodied AI.

<!--
My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

- **ICE: In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
ICE is a novel framework that brings in-place prompting to diffusion large language models (dLLMs). It directly embeds prompts into masked token positions during a dLLM's iterative refinement process, enabling more flexible, bidirectional information flow.To boost efficiency, ICE features a confidence-aware early exit mechanism. Our results show it delivers a 17.29% accuracy increase and a 4.12x speedup on GSM8K, while achieving up to 276.67x acceleration on MMLU with strong performance.

to Echocardiography Probe Guidance](https://github.com/yxwang1215/yxwang1215.github.io/blob/main/_pdf/2506_BIBM_Adapting_Ultrasound_Foundation_Model_to_Echocardiography_Probe_Guidance.pdf)

Haojun Jiang, Teng Wang, **Yuxuan Wang**, Gao Huang

- We propose a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) that adapts large ultrasound foundation models for real-time probe guidance in echocardiography. The VA-Adapter encodes vision-action sequences and leverages the model‚Äôs sequential reasoning to help junior sonographers acquire high-quality cardiac ultrasound images. By fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, our approach surpasses strong baselines and improves accessibility to timely heart disease diagnosis.
